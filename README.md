## Smoke detection project
I developed this project for a chemical factory in Kochi to detect harmful smokes based on colour and alert the workes to stop the manufacturing process. 
I made the dataset from scratch by leveraging SAM, Grounding Dino and Stable Diffusion and made the real time detection system using yoloV8 and opencv
